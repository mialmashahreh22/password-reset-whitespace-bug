## Overview

A password reset flow accepts a password with leading whitespace, but login later rejects or normalizes it differently, locking the user out.

This repository is a **sanitized educational case study**. It does not target a real company or live system. The included lab uses mock data so students can safely understand the bug class.

## Quick Facts

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | Authentication / Input Consistency |
| Severity | Medium |
| Related CWE | CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity or Whitespace |
| Lab | Browser-based CTF |
| Flag Style | `FLAG{...}` |

## Play the CTF Lab

Run locally:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/labs/ctf-game/
```

Goal: solve the three missions and reveal the flag.
